# Console Website
A template for making websites with a console-like interface. See an example at https://diefonk.net/console.

The files you need are `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `Directory.js`, and `utility.js`. The only file you need to edit with your own content is `script.js`, but feel free to poke around in the other files and change things up.
