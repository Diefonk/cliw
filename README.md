# cliw

cliw is a template for making websites with a command line interface. See it in action at [diefonk.net/cliw](https://diefonk.net/cliw).

The files you need are `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, `Directory.js`, and `utility.js`. The only files you need to edit with your own content are `index.html` and `main.js`, but feel free to poke around in the other files and change things up.
